## Config

`examples/config/config.toml` Is an example config file that will be used when no other config file was found.

This config file should be placed in a directory called `linkage` in the `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` directory. On Linux systems, this means that the programs look for the config file in `~/.config/linkage/config.toml`.
